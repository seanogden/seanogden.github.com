        <h3>Recent Work</h3>

<h4>HyperDex</h4>

<p>I've been working with the HyperDex team to extend support for non-Linux operating systems.  So far, we've completed builds on OSX and Windows, with support for the .NET runtime languages.</p>

<h4>Chain Replicated State Machines</h4>

<p>Replicated state machine implementations traditionally rely on Paxos to consistently order commands to replicas. Paxos' complexity makes such systems difficult to implement correctly and limits their throughput. I addressed these limitations by using chain replication instead of Paxos to build a replicated state machine with much higher throughput and simpler implementation than previously existing systems.</p>

<h4>Consistency Testing Suite</h4>

<p>Key-value store performance benchmarks such as YCSB can be quite helpful in objectively comparing different NoSQL systems.  However, there is no system to test the consistency guarantees that many distributed data stores make.  Given the often vague language used to describe consistency in NoSQL storage systems, it is not easy to compare systems to each other with regards to consistency.  Therefore, I have been developing a cloud platform that actively causes failures and simulates poor network conditions at the operating system layer in order to perform repeatable tests for consistency and robustness of distributed systems without the need to modify the target system. </p>

<h4>PortOS</h4>

<p>PortOS is an educational operating system designed for undergraduate operating systems courses.  It provides the infrastructure necessary to build user-space operating systems.  I ported the system to OSX and Linux.</p>

<h3>Teaching</h3>

<h4>Operating Systems</h4>

<p>I TA for the Operating Systems class in the Fall at Cornell.</p>

<h4>Computer Networking</h4>

<p>I'm currently TAing the Computer Networking course at the new Cornell Tech campus in NYC.</p>
